# Small fixes LYNX applies to the JUCE sources before they are compiled (idempotent: a patched file is left alone).
#
# 1. Linux drag & drop from a Wayland file manager (issue #11, round 165s). On GNOME (mutter) and KDE (KWin) Wayland the
#    compositor's XWayland bridge sends XdndEnter with XDND version 5 to every X11 window, whatever version the window
#    announced in XdndAware. JUCE 8.0.4 (and JUCE's develop branch, 2026-10) ignores any XdndEnter above version 3, so
#    no drop from Nautilus/Dolphin ever reached LYNX. Versions 4 and 5 only add fields a version 3 target may ignore
#    (XdndProxy, XdndFinished's result), so versions 3..5 are accepted now.
# 2. GTK 4 apps (Nautilus 4x+) offer a file drag as "text/plain;charset=utf-8" BEFORE "text/uri-list"; JUCE took the
#    first offered type it knows, got the paths as plain text and delivered a text drag that no file drop target wants.
#    "text/uri-list" is preferred whenever the source offers it.
# 3. A drop JUCE could not take (no type it knows, or the version check above) left `finishAfterDropDataReceived` set,
#    so the NEXT drag was "finished" as soon as its data arrived on XdndEnter (JUCE asks for it early) and dropped at
#    the enter message's meaningless position: one failed drag made the next good one land nowhere. Reset on enter.
#    (1-3: juce_gui_basics/native/juce_DragAndDrop_linux.cpp, compiled on Linux/BSD only.)
# 4. Every platform, juce_gui_basics/windows/juce_ComponentPeer.cpp: a file drop that no component took (an unsupported
#    file, or dropped where nothing accepts files) kept `lastDragAndDropCompUnderMouse`, so the next drag that starts
#    over that same component (the Playlist next to the file manager) never looked for a target and was refused.
#
# Used by CMake (lynx_patch_juce on the fetched JUCE) and by scripts/build-windows-zig.sh, which runs this file with
# `cmake -DJUCE_DIR=<a copy of JUCE's juce_gui_basics module> -P cmake/LynxPatchJuce.cmake`.

# One fix: `old` (lines joined with "|NL|") replaced by `new` unless `marker` is already in the file.
